# ðŸ§© Avatar Customization System Starter

Welcome! This is a basic scaffold for the Pocket Worlds Senior Game Engine Developer take-home.

## ðŸ”§ Project Setup

1. Open in Unity 2021.3+ (URP or Standard RP)
2. Youâ€™ll find basic scripts under `Assets/Scripts`
3. Use ScriptableObjects to define avatar parts and assemble them at runtime

## ðŸš€ Suggested Next Steps

- Create some placeholder meshes (e.g., hair, top, bottom)
- Create ScriptableObjects for parts and assign prefabs
- Attach `AvatarAssembler` to a GameObject and assign the parent transform
- Write a small controller to load and apply configs
- Add animation (e.g., idle pose using Animator)
- Try batching / instancing / mesh combining to reduce draw calls

## ðŸ“¸ Include with Submission

- Short README explaining your design and optimization choices
- Screenshots or profiler summary showing draw call reduction

Good luck!
